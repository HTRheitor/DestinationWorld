## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* HTML5 (semantic structure)
* CSS3 (CSS variables, animations, flexbox)
* JavaScript (vanilla/pure)


## üíª How to Run
To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open index.html in your browser or use a local server (like Live Server extension for VSCode)


## üìã Implemented Features

## üé® Design System
* **Colors**: System based on dark tones (#0c0c14) with vibrant orange (#ff6b35) as highlight
* **Typography**: Playfair Display for impactful titles and Plus Jakarta Sans for text
* **Spacing**: Modular system based on 8px units for visual consistency
* **Animations**: Smooth transitions with natural acceleration curves for fluid experience

## üìÑ Single File Approach

The project employs a single-file architecture, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within one HTML document. This approach offers several advantages:

* **Simplified Deployment**: No need to manage multiple files or worry about relative paths
* **Instant Setup**: Just download a single file and open it in any browser without server configuration
* **Reduced HTTP Requests**: Improves initial load performance by eliminating external file requests
* **Self-Contained**: The entire application exists in one file, making it easy to share and distribute
* **Streamlined Development**: Facilitates rapid prototyping and iteration without switching between files

While this approach isn't always suitable for larger projects, it provides an elegant solution for focused, demonstration-oriented applications like this tourism interface. The inline CSS and JavaScript remain well-organized with clear commenting to maintain code readability despite the integrated structure.
